      <description>Can Computers Make Art? Of course not, you might say. They are machines! Creativity is what makes us human. Art is the epitomy of creativity, and thus the epitomy of humanity. If machines can make art, then what are we?
Enter the Portrait of Edmond Belamy sold for $432,500 at Christie&amp;rsquo;s art auction in October 2018. On the surface, this portrait looks like just another painting. It vaguely resembles a portrait of a man but has some quirky characteristics that one might attribute to the author&amp;rsquo;s peculiar vision - the unfinished edges, the blurry face, the studded texture.</description>

      <description>For this project, my team and I attempted to classify the &amp;ldquo;mood&amp;rdquo; of song lyrics with a Convolutional Neural Network. We achieved a classification accuracy of 77%. Other published research works with heavily engineered SVM models scored less than 70%.
FYI - this page is a work-in-progress Motivation This project was completed as part of UC Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s Masters of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program in the course &amp;ldquo;W266 Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>How can data science be applied to the weight room? Chances are, you or someone you know are a member of a gym or an athletic club and lift weights periodically. Numerous companies provide gym membership benefits to their employees or host weight rooms on their campuses. Weight lifting is pervasive: it is used by both casual and professional athletes as part of their training programmes. With all of these people lifting weights, there must be some rich, analyzeable data out there for data scientists to play with, right?</description>

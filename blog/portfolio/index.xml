      <description>For this project, my team and I attempted to classify the &amp;ldquo;mood&amp;rdquo; of song lyrics with a Convolutional Neural Network. We achieved a classification accuracy of 77%. Other published research works with heavily engineered SVM models scored less than 70%.
FYI - this page is a work-in-progress Motivation This project was completed as part of UC Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s Masters of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program in the course &amp;ldquo;W266 Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning&amp;rdquo;.</description>

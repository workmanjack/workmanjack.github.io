<p>Of course not, you might say. They are machines! Creativity is what makes us human. Art is the epitomy of creativity, and thus the epitomy of humanity. If machines can make art, then what are we?</p>

<p>Enter the <em>Portrait of Edmond Belamy</em> sold for $432,500 at Christie&rsquo;s art auction in October 2018. On the surface, this portrait looks like just another painting. It vaguely resembles a portrait of a man but has some quirky characteristics that one might attribute to the author&rsquo;s peculiar vision - the unfinished edges, the blurry face, the studded texture. Is it worth $432,500? I&rsquo;ll leave that up to you to decide.</p>

<p>Alone in the corner is a series of characters where you might normally expect an artist&rsquo;s signature. To the uninitiated, these characters resemble something that looks like a mathematical function. What a strange thing to put on a piece of art, you might say! To those familiar with deep learning neural networks, you have already figured it out. These characters spell out a network&rsquo;s loss function meaning that <em>this work of &ldquo;art&rdquo; was produced by a machine</em>.</p>

<p>I invite you to read <a href="https://www.christies.com/features/A-collaboration-between-two-artists-one-human-one-a-machine-9332-1.aspx" target="_blank">the article on the Christie&rsquo;s website</a> for the full story behind this painting. To summarize, the <em>Portrait of Edmond Belamy</em> was produced by a French art collective known as <a href="http://obvious-art.com/" target="_blank">Obvious</a> that focuses on the boundaries between art and artificial intelligence. For this portrait, they used a type of network known as a Generative Adversarial Network (or GAN; more on these down below) trained on 15,000 portraits painted between the 14th and 20th centuries.</p>

<p>With this knowledge in hand, I ask you again - can computers make art? Obvious and Christie&rsquo;s seem to think so. Or at least, they believe that algorithms can aid in the creation of art. After all, did the art come in the form of the painting or of the process the artists used to train and produce the painting? How about a musician using a backing track produced by AI? Is that laziness on the behalf of the musician or digital, new-age creativity?</p>

<p>These are the questions that inspired me to pursue the topic of Novel 3D Object Generation for the capstone project of my <a href="https://datascience.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Masters of Information and Data Science (MIDS)</a> program at UC Berkeley. Obvious proved the viability of AI-assisted art in the 2D space with the <em>Portrait of Edward Belamy</em>, but what about 3D art? Can data science and machine learning be utilized to produce novel 3D shapes and designs worthy of being called &ldquo;art&rdquo;?</p>
